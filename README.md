# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Analysis-based-Assignment
This is a activity given by Floxus while doing workshop entitled "Machine Learning Workshop" which was for a week.

During this workshop, I have been familiarized with different machine learning models such PyCaret and other data visualization libraries. We went through analyzing the data and finding insighfull by plotting and visualization in graphical forms with the help of seaborn and matplotlib libraries.

Pycaret is powerful library which includes all machine learning models and easy to implement on dataset. It gives comparative analysis of data among different ML-models. It helps to solve the imbalance problem of data whch generally occured because of lack of data for particular class. We use expresssion ( setup(data= dataset_name, target= "column_name, fix_imbalance= True)) to handle imbalance. This library also helps to find out the appropriate hyperparameters to build the model for the given dataset.  

Here in this assignment, I have chosen datasets from kaggle for implementation and I have found insightful from the data and have analysed using questionnaire. I have also implemented PyCaret and done comparative study among different machine learning models.
